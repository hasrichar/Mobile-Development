# BeCipes - Mobile Development
A platform that makes it easy for you to get healthy food. Use this platform to help you easily serve healthy food, get information about nutritional health, and cooking techniques.

## Architecture
The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern with a Clean Architecture approach. This architecture promotes separation of concerns and provides a scalable and maintainable codebase. Here's an overview of the project's architecture:

- **Presentation Layer**: Contains the UI components, including activities, fragments, and Jetpack Compose screens. It interacts with the ViewModel layer to retrieve and display data to the user.

- **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic of the application. It defines the various use cases and orchestrates the interactions between the data layer and the presentation layer.

- **Data Layer**: Contains the repositories and data sources responsible for retrieving and persisting data. It abstracts the underlying data storage implementation and provides a clean interface for the Use Case layer.
